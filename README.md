# Dutch Auction NFT Contract.

This smart contract implements a Dutch auction for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. A Dutch auction is a type of auction where the price starts high and gradually decreases until a buyer is found.

In this particular implementation, the auction will start at a high price and decrease by a fixed amount every block until a buyer purchases the NFT or the auction expires.
